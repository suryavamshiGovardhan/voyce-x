                  A person can be confident, logical, articulate, funny.

                  This is not rare. This is not weakness. This is not {`"`}lack of confidence.{`"`}

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">Here{`'`}s a simple truth most people never hear:</p>
                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground my-4">
                  The human brain processes attraction before it processes love.
                </blockquote>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Attraction comes first. Love may or may not come later.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Attraction triggers the same systems as <strong>threat detection</strong>. Why? Because attraction creates stakes.
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-foreground/90 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>When you are alone:</strong> Nothing is at risk.</li>
                  <li><strong>When you talk to a shopkeeper:</strong> Only money is at risk.</li>
                  <li><strong>When you talk to someone you{`'`}re attracted to:</strong> Self-worth is at risk. Identity is at risk. Rejection is possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  The brain hates uncertainty. So it activates: increased heart rate, heightened awareness, self-monitoring, fear of mistakes.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  This is controlled by the <strong>amygdala</strong>, the same part of the brain that activates during fear and danger.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  So when your body reacts strongly near someone you like, it is not saying:

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Around the opposite gender, many people don{`'`}t become stupid. They start <strong>performing</strong>.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Performance mode is deadly for natural intelligence.
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-foreground/90 space-y-1">
                  <li>Intelligence works best when attention is <strong>external</strong></li>
                  <li>Anxiety increases when attention turns <strong>internal</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Near attraction, attention goes inward: {`"`}How am I looking?{`"`} {`"`}Did that sound stupid?{`"`} {`"`}What if they judge me?{`"`}
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Now the brain is doing two jobs at once: (1) managing the conversation and (2) managing self-image. Result: <strong>overload</strong>.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  That{`'`}s why jokes fall flat, simple sentences break, and confidence feels artificial.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                  You are not awkward. You are over-observing yourself.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  In many societies, especially ours:

                  <li>Interaction between genders is restricted early</li>
                  <li>Curiosity is framed as {`"`}wrong{`"`}</li>
                  <li>Expression is framed as {`"`}shameful{`"`}</li>

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  So the brain learns one thing early:

                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground my-4">

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Then suddenly, adulthood arrives. Now interaction is expected — but the brain has no practice.
                  No exposure. No normalisation. Only pressure.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  In cultures where mixed interaction is normal from childhood, this abnormal behavior is far less intense.
                  Not because people are better. Because their brains are <strong>trained earlier</strong>.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  There was a time in my life when interaction didn{`'`}t feel like conversation.

                  Loss, silence, authority fear, emotional gaps — they don{`'`}t disappear in social situations.
