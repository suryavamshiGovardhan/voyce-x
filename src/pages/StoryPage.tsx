                <p className="blog-text mb-4">
                  I'm a traitor, who betrayed myself for no reasons. I'm a person who lied to my own self at every step of my life. No one is responsible for my suffering cos I only suffer from my own thoughts that could lead me to death. No I'm not a love failure, afterall idk how and what love is. No I'm not addicted to anything, afterall I'm a person who hates it. I don't want to listen to the smiles. Smiles of the people. I have 100 reasons to find myself wrong. But I don't have a single reason who proves myself right to me.

                <p className="blog-text mb-4">
                  Finally, the day is here which I was dreaming of, not thinking about for a long time. People around me said I'd start hating myself, and now I am. I'm angry at myself—not for my mistakes, but for a bunch of emotions; not for self-doubt, but for being kind; not for selfishness, but for being selfless every time. I am angry at myself because I never thought about myself, something I never wanted to do after my dad's death.
                </p>
                <p className="blog-text mb-4">
                  It's not about my mistakes, and it never was. I know them; I have always been aware of what I've done, but I thought someone could notice me. I was and am a people-pleaser. I showed my weaknesses to the world, and even to myself, because I was stuck on a quote of mine that says, "Self-analysis may always disclose a person's weakness which is hard to acknowledge."
                </p>
                <p className="blog-text mb-4">
                  Yes, I was like that right from my childhood. I never wanted to talk, feel free around others, exhibit myself, or wanted to try. I don't know why, and thinking about it now is useless because I don't remember how I behaved in my childhood. I only remember my anger, a legitimate patience for waiting for anything, adjustments, and the echoes of shattered voices (small fights and all).

                <p className="blog-text mb-4">
                  I don't want to stay, but I do. I just can't handle how my silence yells, 'You are wrong, I can't stay,' and that's why I'm here. I don't want to stay. Why can't I feel comfortable for once. I don't want to stay because every person wants me to talk, but I can't express because it invalidates even my smile. So all I can say is I'm just here. But I can't go. What's wrong with me. It's not my mistakes, my parents' fights, or a girl's love, and that's why you're wrong. I just don't have any idea why I don't even want to open my mouth.

                <p className="blog-text mb-4">
                  They have bewildered me with their difficulties, kicked me into silences I've carried for years. I tried to stand up from my knees but nor can I sit within it for too long—or too short. And so, I choose rebellion. I choose to escape. I run further into myself, and I isolate. I'm at my worst.

                  I don't want to stay. I'm the weakest mind in a room full of open skills. I shrink around light because I don't know how to hold it. I don't want to stay. Because if I stay—you'll try to save me and I'm not sure I deserve saving.

                  "She asked me, 'Why can't you fall in love with someone who craves you?' And I almost laughed. Not at her, But at the thought that anyone could love a shadow still questioning if it's even real. I told her, 'I don't fear love. I fear being seen.' Because how can you offer a heart that you yourself don't believe exists?"
