                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  During the day, your brain is in <strong>task mode</strong>.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  It processes actions: walk here, eat this, reply to that message, finish that work.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  At night, when tasks stop, the brain switches to <strong>processing mode</strong>.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Processing mode is when the brain sorts through everything it collected during the day — emotions, impressions, unresolved problems.
                </p>
                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground my-4">
                  The brain does not stop working when you stop working. It simply changes what it works on.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  This is controlled by the <strong>Default Mode Network (DMN)</strong> — the part of the brain that activates when you are not focused on the outside world.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  The DMN is responsible for self-reflection, memory consolidation, and future planning. At night, it runs at full power.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Cortisol</strong> is your stress hormone. But it also serves as your emotional shield.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  During the day, cortisol is high. It keeps you alert, focused, and emotionally regulated.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  At night, cortisol drops to its lowest level — preparing your body for sleep.

                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-destructive pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground my-4">
                  When cortisol drops, emotional suppression weakens. Feelings you managed to push aside all day now surface freely.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>Dopamine</strong> is the chemical that makes things feel interesting, rewarding, and worth doing.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Throughout the day, you use dopamine constantly — every notification, every meal, every small achievement releases a tiny amount.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  During the day, the world is noisy. People talk. Screens flash. Work demands attention.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  At night, the noise stops. And when external noise stops, <strong>internal noise gets louder</strong>.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  This is why many people cannot fall asleep without a podcast, music, or a video playing.

                  They are not addicted to content. They are <strong>afraid of silence</strong> — because silence brings thoughts they have been avoiding all day.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Ever wonder why the brain replays embarrassing moments at night?
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  It is not trying to torture you. It is trying to <strong>learn</strong>.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  The brain treats social mistakes like survival threats. When it replays them, it is running simulations:

                  This is an ancient survival mechanism. In early human groups, social rejection meant death — isolation from the tribe.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                  Your brain replays because it cares about your survival. It just does not know the difference between a tribal exile and a slightly awkward text message.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed italic">
                  There have been nights where the ceiling became a screen — and every mistake, every loss, every unsaid word played on repeat.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Many people carry an entire day of unprocessed emotion into the night. Then blame themselves for not being able to sleep.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                  The problem is not that you think too much at night. The problem is that you feel too little during the day.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  The solution is not to fight the thoughts. It is to <strong>process emotions earlier</strong> — through journaling, reflection, or simply sitting with silence before it forces itself upon you.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
                  Those who learn to sit with silence during the day are rarely haunted by it at night.
