                  You have food. You have shelter. You have safety.

                  Animals do not ask this question. A cat with food and warmth is content.

                  But humans — even with everything they need — feel an ache. A pull. A quiet restlessness that whispers:

                  This is not greed. This is not dissatisfaction. This is the most fundamental feature of human consciousness.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">Part 1: The Brain Is a Pattern-Seeking Machine</h2>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  The human brain evolved to find patterns.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Pattern recognition kept us alive: recognizing seasons, predicting danger, reading faces.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  But the brain does not stop at physical patterns. It searches for <strong>meaning patterns</strong> too.

                  <li>What happens after death?</li>
                  <li>Why does anything exist at all?</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  These questions have no final answers. But the brain keeps asking — because <strong>it was built to search</strong>, not to arrive.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Every other species on Earth exists to survive and reproduce. That is their entire program.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Humans are the only species that can survive perfectly — and still feel empty.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived the Holocaust, observed:

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  People in the concentration camps who had a sense of purpose — a reason to survive — endured longer than those who had only physical strength.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                  Meaning is not a luxury. For humans, it is a survival need.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Here is a paradox that confuses many people:
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  <strong>The more comfortable life becomes, the more the question of meaning intensifies.</strong>
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  When you are struggling to eat, you do not ask {`"`}Why am I here?{`"`} You are too busy surviving.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  But when survival is handled — when the bills are paid and the fridge is full — the brain has nothing left to solve except the deepest question of all:
                </p>
                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground my-4">

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  This is why depression rates are highest in wealthy nations. Not because wealth causes sadness, but because <strong>wealth removes the distractions that kept the question of meaning at bay</strong>.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Every civilization has tried to answer the meaning question.

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-foreground/90 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Religion</strong> says: {`"`}God has a plan. Trust it.{`"`}</li>

                  <li><strong>Science</strong> says: {`"`}There may be no meaning. Accept it.{`"`}</li>

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  None of these answers is complete. But all of them serve the same function: they give the brain something to hold onto when the void feels too large.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                  The search for meaning is not about finding the right answer. It is about the act of searching itself — which gives life direction.

                  The moment you are fully present — watching a sunset, holding a conversation, listening to rain — the question of meaning dissolves.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Not because you found the answer. But because <strong>the question no longer matters when you are fully alive</strong>.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed italic">
                  I have searched for meaning in books, in people, in achievements, in silence.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed italic">
                  And the closest I have ever come to finding it was in the moments I stopped searching — and simply paid attention.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  The search for meaning is what makes us human. But the ability to be present without needing meaning — that is what makes us free.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  You will never find a final answer to {`"`}Why am I here?{`"`}

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  But the fact that you ask — the fact that a pile of atoms arranged as a human being can look at the stars and wonder {`"`}Why?{`"`} — is itself extraordinary.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
                  The search for meaning is not a problem to solve. It is the most beautiful proof that you are conscious, alive, and deeply human.
