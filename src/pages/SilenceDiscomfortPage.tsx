                  Someone coughs. Someone picks up their phone. Someone says something — anything — just to break the emptiness.

                  Silence is not painful. It is not dangerous. Nothing happens during silence.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  When you are talking, you are <strong>performing</strong>. You are projecting an image. You are managing what others think of you.
                </p>

                  When silence arrives, the performance stops.

                  Silence is uncomfortable not because nothing is happening — but because you are forced to notice what is already happening inside you.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Most people have never been trained to sit with their own thoughts without distraction. So silence feels like exposure.

                  Think about childhood.

                  <li>When a parent went silent, it often meant anger</li>

                  <li>When a teacher went silent, it often meant disappointment</li>

                  The brain learned early: <strong>silence = something is wrong</strong>.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  So now, even in neutral situations, silence triggers a low-level alarm in the nervous system.

                  You don{`'`}t consciously think {`"`}I am being rejected.{`"`} But the body feels it. The chest tightens. The hands fidget. The mouth opens to say something — anything.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Constant noise — music, podcasts, social media, conversations — is not just entertainment.
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  It is <strong>emotional regulation</strong>.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  Noise keeps the brain occupied. When the brain is occupied, it cannot process painful truths, unresolved emotions, or uncomfortable questions.

                <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic text-muted-foreground my-4">
                  People do not fear silence. They fear what silence will make them feel.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  This is why some people sleep with the TV on. Why some people cannot eat alone without a screen. Why some people panic when their phone dies.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  In social settings, silence carries a hidden meaning: <strong>{`"`}I have nothing valuable to say.{`"`}</strong>
                </p>
                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  In a world where speaking equals intelligence, wit, and confidence — silence feels like failure.

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-foreground/90 space-y-1">
                  <li>The quiet person is seen as boring</li>

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  So people talk. Not because they have something to say, but because silence feels like social death.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  This is especially intense in cultures that reward verbal dominance — classrooms, workplaces, families where the loudest voice wins.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed italic">
                  There is a reason meditation is difficult.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  It is not the sitting. It is not the posture. It is the silence.

                  When you sit in silence, the mind shows you everything you have been running from:

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed italic">
                  I used to fill every gap with words, noise, movement — anything to avoid the weight of a quiet room.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed italic">
                  It was not until I stopped running from silence that I understood what it was trying to show me.

                  Silence is not emptiness. It is fullness — so full that most people cannot handle what it contains.

                  The day you stop fearing silence is the day you stop fearing yourself.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed">
                  The discomfort you feel in silence is not caused by silence.

                  It is caused by everything you have been avoiding — and silence simply removes the distractions that kept it hidden.

                <p className="text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed font-semibold">
                  Learn to sit with silence. Not to find peace — but to find truth.
