const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Is VOYCE therapy?",
    a: "No. VOYCE is a reflective, educational wellbeing space. It does not diagnose, treat, or replace a therapist, counsellor, or doctor.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my school or my parents read what I write?",
    a: "No. Journal entries and check-ins are private to your account. Schools only ever see aggregated, non-identifying activity — never an individual entry.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does VOYCE score or rank me?",
    a: "No. There is no risk score, no diagnosis label, and no leaderboard of feelings. You see your own patterns; nobody else grades them.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I write something that worries you?",
    a: "VOYCE is not monitored in real time and is not an emergency service. If you are in danger, contact local emergency services or a helpline such as Tele MANAS (14416) in India.",
  },
  {
    q: "How old do I need to be?",
    a: "13 or older, with a parent or guardian's knowledge if you are under 18.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I delete my data?",
    a: "Yes. You can delete your account and everything stored with it at any time from your profile, or by emailing voycexx@gmail.com.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is VOYCE free?",
    a: "The student check-in, reflection, and resource library are free to use. School pilots are arranged directly with us.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who built VOYCE?",
    a: "VOYCE was founded by Suryavamshi Govardhan. There is no anonymous team behind it — you can reach the founder directly.",
  },
];
