              Most young people aren&rsquo;t hiding something dramatic. They&rsquo;re waiting for a moment where saying
              something costs less than staying quiet. VOYCE helps you notice earlier and ask better.

              serious, the honest answer is a person — and VOYCE says so clearly, with the routes to reach one.
