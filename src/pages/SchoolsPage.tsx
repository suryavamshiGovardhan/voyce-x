            VOYCE is a private check-in and reflection space. It is not a diagnostic tool, not a screening
            instrument, and not a monitoring dashboard. It helps students put language to what they feel and
            points them toward a human when that is what they need.

            VOYCE is early. We would rather say that plainly than publish percentages we cannot evidence.
            When a school pilot runs, we will publish what actually happened — named, dated, and with the
            school's written permission. Until then, this page contains no statistics, no testimonials, and no
            partner logos.
