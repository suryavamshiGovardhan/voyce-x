                There's a moment in every founder's journey when purpose becomes undeniable. For me, that moment 
                arrived not in a boardroom or a classroom, but in the quiet spaces where I witnessed the silent 
                struggles of people around me — friends, family, strangers — all battling invisible battles with 
                their minds.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">The Problem I Couldn't Ignore</h2>
              <p>
                Growing up in India, I observed a troubling pattern: mental health was either ignored entirely or 
                treated as a stigma. Young people in rural and semi-urban areas had virtually no access to mental 
                health resources. When someone struggled with anxiety, depression, or stress, the common response 
                was to "just deal with it" or "be strong."
              </p>
              <p>
                But strength isn't about suppression. True strength comes from understanding ourselves — our minds, 
                our emotions, our patterns. And that understanding requires access to knowledge that was, for many, 
                completely out of reach.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">The Bridge Between Worlds</h2>
              <p>
                As I studied psychology and human behavior, I discovered something remarkable: the ancient wisdom 
                of Eastern philosophy — Buddhist concepts of suffering, mindfulness practices, the understanding 
                of desire and attachment — aligned beautifully with modern psychological research. The insights 
                from neuroscience validated what meditation practitioners had known for centuries.
              </p>
              <p>
                This realization became the foundation of <Link to="/" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">VOYCE-X</Link>. 
                I wanted to create a platform that didn't just offer clinical information but wove together the 
                threads of science, philosophy, and practical wisdom into something accessible, engaging, and 
                genuinely helpful.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">Building for Real People</h2>
              <p>
                VOYCE-X isn't built for metrics or vanity numbers. Every feature exists because it serves a real 
                need. The DSM-5 Academy helps aspiring mental health professionals and curious minds understand 
                diagnostic frameworks. The mood tracking and journaling features give users tools for self-reflection. 
                The philosophical articles explore the deeper questions of existence and meaning.
              </p>
              <p>
                And critically, everything is available in multiple languages — Telugu, Hindi, English, Kannada, 
                Tamil — because language should never be a barrier to understanding one's own mind.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">The Vision Ahead</h2>
              <p>
                VOYCE-X is just beginning. With AI-powered insights, community features, and continuously expanding 
                educational content, the platform will grow to serve more people in more meaningful ways. But the 
                core mission remains unchanged: to make emotional wellbeing accessible, understandable, and 
                achievable for everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you're reading this and have ever felt alone in your struggles, know that you're not. 
                <Link to="/" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium"> VOYCE-X</Link> exists because 
                I believe every person deserves the tools to understand themselves and navigate their inner world 
                with clarity and compassion.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">Join the Journey</h2>
              <p>
                I invite you to explore VOYCE-X, share your story, and become part of a community that values 
                authentic growth over superficial fixes. Together, we can redefine what mental health support 
                looks like — not as a clinical intervention, but as a continuous journey of understanding, 
                acceptance, and transformation.
