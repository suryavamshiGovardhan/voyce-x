Without a clear endpoint, the grief loops endlessly.",
        "**George Bonanno's** research on resilience shows that grief is not linear and does not follow neat \"stages.\" It comes in waves, retreats, returns, and slowly reshapes us. The popular five-stage model is widely misunderstood — it was never meant to be a timeline.",
        "Modern grief research increasingly focuses on **identity reconstruction** — the slow work of rebuilding who you are after loss. We don't \"get over\" significant losses. We *integrate* them. The loss becomes part of the architecture of who we are, not a wound to be erased.",
        "Holding on, in this view, is not weakness — it is the mind's way of refusing to let the meaning of what was lost disappear. The work isn't to *stop* holding on. It is to slowly transfer that meaning into who you are becoming, so the past stops being the only place where that part of you lives.",

It is not a clinical diagnosis — it is a *pattern of thought* in which a person attributes their success to luck, timing, or deception, rather than ability.",
        "It often co-exists with three deeper patterns: **perfectionism** (anything less than flawless feels like failure), **over-functioning** (working twice as hard to compensate for the imagined inadequacy), and **discounting evidence** (filtering out praise and amplifying criticism).",
        "Research links imposter feelings strongly to early environments where love or approval was conditional on performance, where mistakes were punished rather than processed, or where a child was repeatedly compared to a sibling, peer, or imagined standard. The internal critic, in many cases, is a *voice that was once external*.",
        "Importantly, imposter feelings are **most intense in the people most qualified to be where they are**. The Dunning-Kruger effect describes the opposite pattern: those with the least competence often feel the most confident.
