    content: `For months, I told everyone I was okay. I believed it too. I woke up, went to work, smiled at the right times. But late at night, when the world went quiet, I noticed it — a weight I couldn't name. Not sadness exactly. Not anxiety. Just... something off.

I started paying attention. I noticed how I rushed through conversations, how I avoided being alone with my thoughts, how I filled every silence with noise. I was running from something I hadn't even identified yet.

One day, I stopped. I sat with the discomfort. I didn't try to fix it or understand it. I just let it exist. And slowly, it started to speak.

The off-ness wasn't a problem to solve. It was a signal. My body and mind were telling me something needed attention — not urgently, not dramatically, just gently.

That was the beginning of listening to myself.`,
    reflectionQuestion: "Where in your life do you feel this kind of quiet discomfort?"

    id: "invisible-weight",
    title: "Nobody knew I was carrying this.",

    content: `From the outside, my life looked put together. Good job, nice apartment, friends who cared. But inside, I carried a weight nobody could see. I didn't even know how to describe it.

It wasn't depression — I'd felt that before, and this was different. It was more like exhaustion that sleep couldn't fix. A tiredness of pretending, of performing, of being who everyone expected me to be.

I started small. Instead of saying "I'm fine," I tried "I'm okay, just tired." It felt like a confession. Then I tried something harder: I stopped apologizing for needing space.

The weight didn't disappear. But it got lighter when I stopped pretending it wasn't there.`,
    reflectionQuestion: "What weight are you carrying that others can't see?"
  },
  {
    id: "permission-to-rest",
    title: "I finally gave myself permission.",
    excerpt: "For years, I believed rest was something you earned. You worked hard, then you deserved a break. But the work never ended, and neither did my exhaustion.",
    content: `For years, I believed rest was something you earned. You worked hard, then you deserved a break. But the work never ended, and neither did my exhaustion.

One Sunday morning, I woke up and did nothing. Not lazy nothing — intentional nothing. I sat by the window. I watched clouds. I let my thoughts wander without trying to capture them.

It felt wrong at first. Guilt crept in. Shouldn't I be productive? Useful? Better?

Then I realized: I was already useful. I was already enough. The world didn't need more from me in that moment. And neither did I.

That Sunday changed something. Not everything, but something.`,
