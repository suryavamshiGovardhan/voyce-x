              Two emotionally unprepared people get married. Unresolved trauma becomes parenting.
              Stress becomes shouting. Silence becomes neglect. Ego becomes control. Children absorb everything —

            <p>
              Every emotional wound a child carries was, at some point, an unhealed wound in a parent.
              Trauma is not a private event — it is a relay race. Generations carry batons they were never
              shown how to put down.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Invisible Inheritance exists because the most consequential decisions of human life —
              choosing a partner, building a marriage, raising a child — are the only ones society refuses
              to prepare anyone for. We hand out marriage certificates with the same care we hand out movie tickets.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not a relationship app. It is a quiet civilizational repair — an attempt to make
              emotional preparedness as obvious as financial planning, as expected as a driving license.
              If we get this right, we don't just help couples. We change what the next generation walks into.

              We inherit more than wealth and surnames. We inherit the way our father went silent when
              he was hurt. The way our mother smiled when she was breaking. The way pressure became anger.
              The way love became control. We inherit the unfinished sentences of two people who were
              never allowed to feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern marriage is treated as an event. It is, in truth, an emotional contract between
              two nervous systems. When neither has been taught regulation, language, or repair — what
              they build together is not a home. It is a weather system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Emotional illiteracy is not a personal failing. It is a societal omission. The Invisible
              Inheritance is built to close that gap with gentleness, not judgment.

              <li><strong>Emotional Awareness</strong> — naming what you feel before it controls you.</li>
              <li><strong>Communication</strong> — the difference between saying something and being understood.</li>
              <li><strong>Anger Patterns</strong> — anger is a messenger, not a personality.</li>
              <li><strong>Ego Management</strong> — the cost of being right is often being alone.</li>
              <li><strong>Stress Response</strong> — your nervous system is the room your child grows up in.</li>
              <li><strong>Conflict Handling</strong> — fighting is fine. Repair is the skill.</li>
              <li><strong>Financial Pressure</strong> — money is rarely about money.</li>
              <li><strong>Work–Life Balance</strong> — when work owns the parent, the child rents the leftovers.</li>

              <li><strong>Emotional Simulations</strong> — money tight, in-laws arrive, baby cries at 3am.</li>
